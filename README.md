# InfixEvaluator

### Features

 - Evaluate arithmetical expressions with `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `(`, `)`.
 - Define variables with `varname = expr`
 
### How to use

 - Compile and run `Repl.java`, it will create a REPL.
 
 
### Note

 - This program use [this][1] algorithm to evaluate infix expressions.
 - This project is more of a proof of a concept rather than a fully functional project,
 and there is currently no plan to add more fancy features to it. 
 - Anyone is welcome report any bugs and I will try to fix it.
